Project Name: Equity Profile Builder

Problem Statement: 

I’m a community advocate and I want to make equitable policy change in my community. I’m trying to create a comprehensive story about the conditions in my community/state by using local geographic data from the National Equity Atlas, and inserting my own narrative and photos. But there’s no way to easily extract and download the local data and combine it with my personal story, which makes me frustrated because I waste time manually piecing together these pieces.
